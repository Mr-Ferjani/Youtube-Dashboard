# Youtube-Dashboard (Data Science content): Project Overview

* I created a dashboard to help generating insights that can help content creators to improve their channel subscribers/views wise.
* Engineered new relevant features to add more insight and utilized median to describe the data. The median is used to remove the influence of extreme values.
* The median is used to highlight difference between video stats between last 12 months and 6 months. 
* Built a dashboard using streamlit to provide analysis of individual videos performances and highlight the aggregated metrics of the entire channel.
